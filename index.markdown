Updates to the Baseline collection. Including RSS feeds (both for all updates and [individual tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags)): <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml" style="display: inline; margin-left: 4px"><img height=24 style="margin-bottom: -4px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rss.png"></a>

The data source is the [repository](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/) owned by W3C WebDX (aka web developer experience) Community Group. The data is updated every 24 hours. See also their definition of [high vs low Baseline support](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/blob/main/docs/baseline.md#status-definition), but tl;dr:

- **Low Baseline**: Each current stable release of the core browsers has full support. Core browsers are Safari (iOS and macOS), Chrome (Android and desktop), Edge, and Firefox (Android and desktop).
- **High Baseline**: The feature has been in Low Baseline for 30 months.
